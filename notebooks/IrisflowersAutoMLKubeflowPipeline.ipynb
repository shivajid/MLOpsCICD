    "The dataset used is IRIS Dataset for flower classification\n",

    "### Objective\n",
    "In this tutorial, you create a custom image classification using a pipeline with components from  `google_cloud_pipeline_components`. This is just pre-cursor to the rest of the tutorial. We will use the same template of the code to run the next steps of automated training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps performed include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pull from an existing `Dataset` resource.\n",
    "- Train a Custom `Model` resource.\n",
    "- Create an `Endpoint` resource.\n",
    "- Deploy the `Model` resource to the `Endpoint` resource.\n",
    "\n",
